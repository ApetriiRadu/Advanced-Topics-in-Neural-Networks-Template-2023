* I've done a few runs with various optimizers and some randomly generated hyper-parameters and collected the good results. These were worse than I expected, unfortunately.
* The results in the images are not the best that I've obtained, but I've never surpassed the 50% accuracy mark.
* I expect somewhere between 3 and 4 points since I've reached that 40% accuracy target and I've used all the optimizers that were mentioned. However, the code might not be that clean and easy to read. Things could've been done better, that's for sure.
